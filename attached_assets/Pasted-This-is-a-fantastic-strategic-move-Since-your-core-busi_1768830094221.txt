This is a fantastic strategic move. Since your core business is "Direct Factory Access" and "Zero Middlemen," you already have the credibility of being the "boots on the ground" expert. Offering a rescue service for those who didn't use you (and got burned) is a perfect lead magnet. It builds massive trust: "We know the game so well, we can even clean up the mess left by others."

Here is a comprehensive ideation package for this new section, designed to be punchy, relatable, and high-converting.

1. Naming the Section
You want a name that sounds authoritative but not "legalese." It needs to promise a solution immediately.

Top Recommendations:

The Trade Guard (Simple, strong, protective)

Dispute & Recovery Desk (Clear, descriptive)

China Commercial Shield (Implies ongoing protection)

Sourcing Rescue Squad (A bit more aggressive/marketing heavy)

Interbridge Legal Support (Professional, leans on your brand)

Winner Idea: "Trade Recovery & Dispute Resolution" Why? It tells them exactly what you do: you get their money or goods back (Recovery) and you handle the fight (Resolution).

2. The Headline & Hook (Addressing the Fear)
This text should go at the top of the section. We need to validate their anger and offer immediate hope.

Headline: "Deal Gone Wrong? Don’t Write It Off. Fight Back."

Sub-headline: We combine local enforcement power with legal expertise to resolve disputes, recover funds, and hold dishonest suppliers accountable.

Body Copy: "Sourcing from China offers incredible opportunities, but it comes with risks. If you are facing a nightmare scenario—where communication has stopped, quality is unacceptable, or your deposit has vanished—you are not alone, and you are not helpless. Most overseas buyers think their money is gone forever because they don't have a local presence. We do."

3. "Catastrophic" Scenarios (The "Is This You?" Section)
Use these examples to make the customer nod their head and say, "Yes! That's exactly what happened to me!" This agitates the pain before you offer the cure.

Scenario A: The "Golden Sample" Bait & Switch

You received a perfect sample, signed the contract, and wired the deposit. But when the container arrived, the goods were trash—wrong materials, poor stitching, or completely broken items. Now the factory is blaming "shipping damage" or refusing to answer your calls.

Scenario B: The "Ghost" Manufacturer

You found a supplier with a professional website and great English. You paid the 30% deposit. Suddenly, their email bounces, their phone is disconnected, and you realize the "factory" never existed. It was a trading company shell that took your money and ran.

Scenario C: The "Ransom" Price Hike

Production is finished, but suddenly the factory demands an extra 20% payment before they release the Bill of Lading, citing "rising material costs" that were never in the contract. Your goods are being held hostage until you pay up.

4. The Service List (The Solution)
Here we list the specific deliverables. We need to mix "Soft Power" (your presence) with "Hard Power" (the Law Firm).

Our Recovery & Protection Toolkit:

Corporate Background Deep-Dive: We dig beyond the website. We verify business licenses, check local litigation records for prior fraud, and verify if the "factory" is actually a registered manufacturer or just a middleman in a rented office.

On-Site Factory Verification: We send our team to the physical location. If they are ghosting you digitally, we show up at their front gate. A physical presence often forces a response where emails fail.

Legal Demand Letters (Attorney Backed): Through our partner Law Firm specializing in Chinese Commercial Dispute, we issue formal legal notices in Chinese. This signals that you are not just a "foreign buyer" anymore—you are a legal threat.

Mediation & Negotiation: We bridge the cultural and language gap to negotiate settlements, refunds, or corrective manufacturing runs without the need for expensive court battles.

Asset & Credit Investigation: Before you sue, we check if they actually have money or assets to seize, ensuring you don't throw good money after bad.

5. Implementation Strategy (The "Call to Action")
Don't just ask them to "Contact Us." Give them a low-risk first step.
